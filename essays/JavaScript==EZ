  The JavaScript logo always made me think that it was some sort of coffee brand. JavaScript is the fourth language I learned, other languages I have learned are java, C, and python. It is the easiest of the four. The reason why it is the easiest of the four is the simple syntax and there are not a lot of specific rules like java or C. Another reason why the language could be simple for me is, it is the third language I learned, and I had a lot of practice beforehand. Learning the previous languages probably made the transition easier for me.
  
  
  Even though JavaScript is not as challenging as someone who always struggles with everything. I must practice often to improve on something. Whether it be school, sports, games, etc. I sadly have not been blessed with the capabilities of learning on the fly. I use athletic engineering learning style often. I am going to apply the technique to coding more often because a weak spot I have right now is my critical thinking. It takes me awhile to finish interview coding question. My goal would be to cut down on the amount of time it takes to complete an interview coding question because it means my critical thinking skills are getting better. Therefore, practicing WODs is very useful because my first-time doing practice WODs, I was not able to finish. It took me three tries to get to avg. The three tries are probably not accurate because it took me two failed attempts before I could complete the WOD in ten minutes. Athletic Engineering is the best method to learn because it just practice, practice,practice,practice,practice. There is no better way to get better at something than practicing. The method could be stressful at times because if I cannot get to a solution and I have been working on it for many hours and I’m like on the hundredth attempt, it is very frustrating. To help with that I take breaks so my mind can get refreshed. Even though the method is frustrating at times. I would not stop using athletic engineering style learning because I’m the type of person that must repeatedly do something to understand. 
  
  
  One of my proudest educational experiences was in calculus one in community college, where I got a B. This B was one of the most special B, I ever received. At the beginning of the quarter, I was really struggling in the class. I got a D on my first exam, and it made me discouraged. It made me consider if I was even capable of becoming an engineer. After receiving my grade on the first exam, I improved my studying methods and habits. The result of it, I got an A on my remaining exams. Calculus one really showed me that I could achieve what I wanted. In conclusion I applied athletic engineering to my math class and practiced problem repeatedly until I was prepared for the next exam.
