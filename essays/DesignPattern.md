# ***Drilling Down the Design Pattern***
Design patterns are reusable “templates” that can be applied to solve common different problems. Design patterns can be imagined  like a drill and the  fasteners represent the different software engineer problems. The drill attachments represent the software engineer’s solution which is tailored to the problem.   Design pattern allows for quicker implementation time because the engineer would not have to write the repetitive code and they can focus more on the main functions.


# ***Jamb_UH-Ree Pattern***
Design pattern that my team and I have used is the base template. We used the Bowfolios template that was available to us. We chose the Bowfolios for the reason that it had a similar structure for our program, Jamb-UH-ree. The main component from Bowfolios was the structure card and it features like the note stime stamp and joining. We filled the structure with our data and changed the template. From the structure we were able to implement other key features. It saved us a lot of time from creating from scratch. Without the template our team would have taken the majority of the time frame project to just set up.
