## **The Why**
If you never asked for help with your code, then you are a LIAR! Even the most experienced engineers still run into problems. Asking for help is common as a software engineer. To make sure that we do not waste other people’s time and for us to get efficient answers. We must ask smart questions.  Formatting the question to be straight to the point and detailed where the helper can quickly read the question and look at what you did and what you done to fix it. Would help both parties. 
## **The Good**
In [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72562941/visual-studio-2022-find-all-in-entire-solution-is-not-working-properly), the question that was chosen is what I would categorize as a smart question in . The developer posted a question about having trouble using “Find All” Function in the 2022 Visual Studio. He or she gives extra information that they know the key is in the file, but the function doesn’t find it and states that he can find it another way, searching in current document. The developer also does not blame the problem on anybody and ask If the mistake was on his part with configuration step installation after clean installation. With the given smart question, the responses were helpful and no other developers flamed the author of the question. The answers were also clear and concise since the author specified his problem.
## **The Bad**
In [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75254260/how-to-end-an-if-statement), the bad question I chose was a user asking how to end an if statement. The developer was confused about the rules to end it. They did not know if it statement should end with “if-else”, “if” or “if-else”. The question first could have been STFW. It could have been written better. The user could have shown an example of applying the statement to clarify his question. The user should’ve first researched and then explained how they think, and if-else statement works. Another suggestion is fixing the structure of his or her question. Example he capitalizes “u” in “use”, in the middle of a sentence.  Another thing is he or she says thank you and then states a comment of “how they want to know the rules of an if else statement”.
