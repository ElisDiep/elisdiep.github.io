<h2 id="the-ugly-hatchling"><strong>The Ugly Hatchling</strong></h2>
<p>I don’t know how I am a senior in computer engineering. My first couple programming classes were a terrible experience. I was probably one of the worse programmers in the world. It took me days to finish my introduction programming assignments in the beginning when it should of took me only a couple of hours. I could have easily quit and tried a different career path but something in me was very interested in the field. I really was fascinated with it, even though I sucked. Coding was fun to me, I loved how I can build a program from scratch and the applications were endless. Overtime in my educational career I was able to improve my critical thinking skill, comprehension skills and studying habits which led me to become a better programmer.  Even though it still can be frustrating at times, my passion has grown even more.</p>
<h2 id="the-swan"><strong>The Swan</strong></h2>
<p>I’m still new to this world of programming but I am excited to learn all about it. I haven’t really been able to explore the different fields, so I do not know all of my interests yet. As of recently, I have been really intrigued by machine learning. After seeing Chat Gpt trending, I really am fascinated in how we can create an algorithm to be able to do all types of things. Another field I have been really interested in since probably the start of my career is software engineering. The idea of building a product interests me since I know I just don’t want to only be a programmer. I also want to be a businessman. I want to use my skills as a tool to take me further along in life, wherever that be.</p>

<p>I’m really excited to take ICS 314. It is a class that is closely related to where I want to work. I have been really wanting to improve my skills further along and this class will do that. I also don’t have the experience to build a website and to me that is really a crucial thing I need to learn before I graduate. I want to be able to build my own projects because currently before this class. I was only able to create classes, function and learn about algorithms.  Now we are applying what we learned from the previous semester to this class. It‘s like drawing, at first you are learning  the technique but once you master it you are able to make a masterpiece. All the boring and hard work pays off and you get this sense of satisfaction.</p>
