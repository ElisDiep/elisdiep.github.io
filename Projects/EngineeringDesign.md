## **About**
Designed a robotic vehicle to climb two flight of stairs to retrieve an egg. We were given a 500 dollar budget to create an rc vehicle. Students had access to the 3d printer to manufacture parts if needed. My team and I split into three teams, hardware, software, design. 

## **Contribution**
I was the software lead on the team. I handled the electronics design and software part of the vehicle. Contributed to other subsystem by designing and 3d printing parts for the robot. After the competition the team placed 2nd place in the competition. The vehicle was placed in second place of the competition.

## **Outcome**
I got to learn how to 3d print and CAD during the class. It was a really fun experience and made me want to get into 3d printing as a hobby. The class really showed me how far 3d printing has came. It was my first time playing with an Arduino and it was the reason why I changed from mechanical engineering to computer engineering. The reason why is i had more fun playing with an Arduino then 3d printing. I enjoyed the coding part of the project.
