## **What is it**
  Working with Air Force Unit Training Managers and National Security Innovation Network (NSIN) to create a web application for the Air Force to track progress of training. The web application is an improved version of their current system. The current system they have is not tailored for their needs. 

## **Background**
Project started in a engineering start up class called Hacking for Defense. Learn to apply the lean methodology to come up with a minimal viable product. Lean methodology concepts is to get as much knowledge before creating a solution. After completing 41 interviews. The team and I created a bubble mock up of what the web application appearance would be and its function. After presenting the minimal viable product (M.V.P), there were a lot of positive feedback on the M.V.P that the N.S.I.N director wanted to continue the project and turn it into a real product and fund it.

##  **Features**
+ Mass update
+ Display percentage of training dashboard
+ Profile update
+ Certification upload
+ Notification system
The features were either improved or added that the current system the Air Force does not have.

## **Currently**
Currently the team is working on turning the MVP into a real product......
